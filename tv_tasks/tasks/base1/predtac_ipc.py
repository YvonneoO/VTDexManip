"""File-based IPC between an online-PPO process (Isaac Gym, pinned old torch)
and the tactile-prediction server process (Ego2Contact's predtac_server.py,
touchanything env, modern torch/transformers) -- these two stacks cannot
coexist in one process, so P+Pred-Tac training needs two processes talking
over something version-agnostic. Plain numpy + os is importable unmodified
from either environment, so this module is the ONLY thing shared by both
sides -- no torch import here at all.

VENDORED VERBATIM from the DexterousHands repo's
bidexhands/tactile_collection/predtac_ipc.py so VTDexManip's own online PPO
(handover.py's "PredTac" obs_type) can talk to the SAME predtac_server.py
process/protocol without a cross-repo import -- the wire format is
simulator-agnostic (server only sees frames+boxes in, continuous+binary out),
so this file is identical on purpose. Keep the two in sync if either changes.

Design is deliberately ASYNCHRONOUS / stale-tolerant, not a lockstep
request/response per tick: the client overwrites one request file every PPO
tick (fire-and-forget, never blocks on the server), and separately reads
whatever the newest response file says, carrying the last-known tactile
reading forward across ticks until a newer response appears (starting from
all-zeros before the server's first response). This decouples PPO's physics
tick rate from the server's WiLoR+DiT compute rate entirely.

Both request and response are written atomically (write to a temp path in
the SAME directory, then os.replace) so the reader never observes a
partially-written file -- os.replace is atomic on a single POSIX filesystem,
which scratch is.
